jarmor
(Java ASCII armor)

This product is a small collection of stream filters implementing
ASCII armors using standard encoding schemes: Base64, Base32, Base16,
ASCII85 and UUCP.

In order to build the jarmor package, you need the following tools  :

 - ant
   http://jakarta.apache.org

 - junit (only if you want to rerun the tests)
   http://www.junit.org

Building the package is done by the following command :

     ant

This should create a jarmor-xxx.jar file and a
jarmor-xxx-doc.zip file, were xxx is a version number.

To install jarmor, you should put the jarmor-xxx.jar file
somewhere in your CLASSPATH. If you want to install the documentation,
unpack the jarmor-xxx-doc.zip file in a place where your Web server
can find it and put a link to jarmor-xxx-doc/index.html in your
documentation tree.


If you want to run the tests with a swing-based graphical user
interface, you should do :

     ant test

If you wan to run the tests with a text user interface, you should do :

     ant -Dtest.ui=textui test

If you want to run only a subset of the tests, you should set the
test.class property to the root of the subset like this :

     ant -Dtest.class=org.spaceroots.jarmor.Base64DecoderTest test
