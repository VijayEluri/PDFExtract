Abstract
Statistical methods for PP attachment fall into
two classes according to the training material
used: first, unsupervised methods trained on
raw text corpora and second, supervised meth-
ods trained on manually disambiguated exam-
ples. Usually supervised methods win over un-
supervised methods with regard to attachment
accuracy. But what if only small sets of manu-
ally disambiguated material are available? We
show that in this case it is advantageous to in-
tertwine unsupervised and supervised methods
into one disambiguation algorithm that outper-
 forms both methods used alone.1

1 Introduction
Recently, numerous statistical methods for
prepositional phrase (PP) attachment disam-
biguation have been proposed. They can
broadly be divided into unsupervised and su-
pervised methods. In the unsupervised methods
the attachment decision is based on information
derived from large corpora of raw text. The text
may be automatically processed (e.g. by shallow
parsing) but not manually disambiguated. The
most prominent unsupervised methods are the 
Lexical Association score by Hindle and Rooth
(1993) and the cooccurrence values by Ratna-
parkhi (1998). They resulted in up to 82% cor-
rect attachments for a set of around 3000 test
cases from the Penn treebank. Pantel and Lin
(2000) increased the training corpus, added a
collocation database and a thesaurus which im-
proved the accuracy to 84%.

In contrast, the supervised methods are based on
information that the program learns from
manually disambiguated cases. These cases

in a clause headed by the verb V . For example,
the sentence
In Deutschland ist das Ger ̈at u ̈ber die Bad
Homburger Ergos zu beziehen.
[In Germany the appliance may be ordered from Er-
gos based in Bad Homburg.]
leads to the 4-tuple (beziehen, Gerät, über,
Ergos). In this way we obtained 5803 4-tuples
